# Lattice Boltzmann Method

Imitation of the movement of substance molecules.

Project description:

Modifying the 'draw' function by adding the variable 'sum', and making it dependent on the colour value - thus showing concentration through the intensity of the chosen colour.
The 'walk' function is responsible for simulating the movement of the squares on the board according to the rules of cellular automata. Leaving the execution of the streaming operation 
and the change of direction in the case of reflection from the wall, while removing the reflection of the cells from each other and adding the mass distribution.

Technologies used in the project: Python with libraries:
- numpy - a library for scientific calculations, operations on multidimensional arrays and matrices,
- pygame - a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. Pygame adds functionality on top of the excellent SDL library,
- random - a built-in module that you can use to make random numbers,
- PIL - a module for image handling.
